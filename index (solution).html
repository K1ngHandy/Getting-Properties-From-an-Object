    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run". 
    */
/* 
    PROBLEM 1: 
    Create an object called student with properties for name, age, and grade. Use dot notation to access the name property and store it in a variable called studentName. 
    Use square bracket notation to access the age property and store it in a variable called studentAge. 
    Finally, log the grade property using either dot or square bracket notation.
    */
    let student = {
      name: "John",
      age: 16,
      grade: 10
    };

    let studentName = student.name;
    let studentAge = student['age'];

    console.log(student.grade); // or console.log(student['grade']);

    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: 
    Create an object called car with properties for make, model, year, and color.
    Use dot notation to access the make and model properties and concatenate them together with a space in between. Store the result in a variable called carMakeModel.
    Use square bracket notation to access the year property and store it in a variable called carYear.
    Finally, log the color property using either dot or square bracket notation.
    */
    let car = {
      make: "Toyota",
      model: "Camry",
      year: 2022,
      color: "blue"
    };

    let carMakeModel = car.make + ' ' + car.model;
    let carYear = car['year'];

    console.log(car.color); // or console.log(car['color']);

 /* 
    PROBLEM 3: 
    With the code below, use dot notation to log the title and author properties of the book object. 
    Then, use square bracket notation to log the name of the protagonist.
    Finally, use dot notation to log the occupation of the protagonist in the characters array.
    */
    let book = {
      title: "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
      author: "Douglas Adams",
      publicationYear: 1979,
      protagonist: { name: "Arthur Dent", occupation: "Everyman" }
    };
    console.log(book.title); // "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
    console.log(book.author); // "Douglas Adams"

    console.log(book.protagonist['name']); // "Arthur Dent"

    console.log(book.protagonist.occuptation); // "Everyman"

/*
    PROBLEM 4:
    Using the code below, Use square bracket notation to access the math grade and store it in a variable called aliceMathGrade. 
    Then, use dot notation to access the name and history grade for the student and concatenate them together with a space in between. Store the result in a variable called aliceNameAndHistoryGrade. 
    */
   let aliceStudent = {
      name: "Alice",
      grades: { math: 95, science: 83, history: 88 }

    let aliceMathGrade = student.grades['math'];
    console.log(aliceMathGrade); // 95
  
    let aliceNameAndHistoryGrade = student.name + ' ' + student.grades.history;
    console.log(aliceNameAndHistoryGrade); // "Alice 88"

     /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): 
    The code below is intended to make a copy of the person object, modify the street 
    property of the address object on the copy, and then log the street property on 
    the original person object to the console. However, there is a bug in the code that 
    is causing it to not work as intended. Your task is to identify and fix the bug.
