    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    Create an object called student with properties for name, age, and grade. Use dot notation to access the name property and
    store it in a variable called studentName. Use square bracket notation to access the age property and store it in a variable
    called studentAge. Finally, log the grade property using either dot or square bracket notation.

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Create an object called car with properties for make, model, year, and color.
    Use dot notation to access the make and model properties and concatenate them
    together with a space in between. Store the result in a variable called carMakeModel.
    Use square bracket notation to access the year property and store it in a variable called carYear.
    Finally, log the color property using either dot or square bracket notation.

     /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    With the code below, use dot notation to log the title and author properties of
    the book object. Then, use square bracket notation to log the
    name of the first character in the characters array.
    Finally, use dot notation to log the occupation of the last character in the characters array.

    /*
    PROBLEM 4:
    Using the code below, Use square bracket notation to access the math grade for the second student in the students array and store it in a variable
    called bobMathGrade. Then, use dot notation to access the name and history grade for the third student in the students array and concatenate them together
    with a space in between.
    Store the result in a variable called charlieNameAndHistoryGrade. Finally, use a loop to iterate over the students array and
    log the name and science grade for each student.

    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING):
    The code below is intended to make a copy of the person object, modify the street
    property of the address object on the copy, and then log the street property on
    the original person object to the console. However, there is a bug in the code that
    is causing it to not work as intended. Your task is to identify and fix the bug.
